            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>We are a group of individuals in the XRPL/Xahau Community focused on infrastructure. We have come together to create a Xahau Governance Game table that rewards validators on Xahau. Our goal is to distribute a portion of our table rewards to Xahau validators. Our ethos is to foster a network of exciting new opportunities.</p>

        <section id="rewards">
            <h2>Token and Reward Summary</h2>
            <p>Our plan to manage infra table tokens and rewards is straightforward. A portion of tokens received by the table as rewards will be routed to reliable validators. To be considered for rewards, each infra instance will need to be online for at least 30 days uninterrupted, and meet minimum thresholds suggested for a validator by Xahaud. We will start with validators and consider expanding to nodes and other infra as we automate our tasks. Below is a breakdown of our tokens and rewards:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>70% of table rewards:</strong> These will be routed to a list of reliable validators selected by table members based on their legitimacy.</li>
                <li><strong>30% of table rewards:</strong> This portion, along with any starting table balance, will be kept at our table to fund infrastructure growth and table members. These funds are owned equally by table members, who will vote on their use, including projects and draws.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We intend to build hooks to automate our table and validator reward distribution.</p>
