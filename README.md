# A Commitment to Innovation and Sustainability
**Infra Table**

## Introduction
We are a group of individuals in the XRPL/Xahau Community focused on infrastructure. We have come together to create a Xahau Governance Game table that rewards validators on Xahau. Our goal is to distribute a portion of our table rewards to Xahau infra operators. Our ethos is to foster a network of exciting new opportunities.

## Founding Members
**@Cbot_XRPL:** One of our network operators, @Cbot_XRPL runs a validator on the Xahau UNL and has over four years of experience in the XRPL community. He owns a business, @Cbotlabs, which provides infrastructure to the XRPL and supports community projects.

**@Gadget78:** Another network operator, @Gadget78 runs a validator for Xahau and has been a member and developer in the XRPL ecosystem for over five years. He actively participates in discussions, creates educational content on setting up nodes for Xahau/XRPL, and is available to answer web/IT questions about running infrastructure on Xahau.

**@DeathRanger14:** Our Community Specialist, @DeathRanger14 has nearly ten years in the XRPL community. Since 2015, he has focused on spreading education about the future of DLT, emphasizing the XRPL/Xahau networks. He dedicates his free time to hosting spaces and participating in discussions on the Internet of Value and DLT possibilities with Xahau/XRPL.

## Token and Reward Summary
Our plan to manage infra table tokens and rewards is straightforward. A portion of tokens received by the table as rewards will be routed to reliable infra operators. To be considered for rewards, each infra instance will need to be online for at least 30 days uninterrupted, and meet minimum thresholds suggested for a validator by Xahaud. Xahau Governance Game validators reciving rewards will be exluded from our reward systems. We will start with validators and consider expanding to nodes and other infra as we automate our tasks. Below is a breakdown of our tokens and rewards:

- **70% of table rewards:** These will be routed to a list of reliable infra operators selected by table members based on their legitimacy.
- **30% of table rewards:** This portion, along with any starting table balance, will be kept at our table to fund infrastructure growth and table members. These funds are owned equally by table members, who will vote on their use, including projects and draws.

We intend to build hooks to automate our table and validator reward distribution.

## Member Guidelines
Table applicants must be active members of the Xahau community and its infrastructure. Founding members must approve new applicants, and current table members must vote on whether to add the applicant. Members must play their part and fulfill their roles or risk being voted off the table. Founding members may only be voted out with a 2-1 vote among the three founders. Table members will meet monthly to vote on members, table structure, communication expectations, amendments, planning, projects, and fund disbursement.
## Roles
Each seat at our table will be required to fulfill a role in community engagement and infrastructure to qualify. Examples of these roles include:

- **Active Participation:** Running infrastructure that supports Xahau and providing support to communities needing help with Xahau and setting up infrastructure.
- **Being Accessible:** Being available in a timely manner when communicating with other table and community members.
- **Remaining Respectful:** Staying respectful and professional when engaging with table and community members.
- **Keep Building:** Continuously upgrading hardware and creating content and examples that lead the way for new Xahau developers.
